**Federated learning with [NVFlare](./federated_learning/nvflare)**

The example here show how to train a federated learning models with [NVFlare](https://pypi.org/project/nvflare/) and MONAI-based trainers.

1. [nvflare_example](./nvflare_example/README.md) shows how to run NVFlare with MONAI on a local machine to simulate a FL setting (server and client communicate over localhost). It also shows how to run a simulated FL experiment completely automated using the admin API.
   
2. [nvflare_example_docker](./nvflare_example/README.md) provides further details on running FL with MONAI and NVFlare using docker containers for the server and each client for easier real-world deployment.
